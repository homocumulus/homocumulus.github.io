Only by using his greater reach is Cedd able to keep the stunted monster at bay. The imp is small, but quick and inhumanly strong. Its claws tear the metal of Ceddâ€™s shield as he blocks a blow. 

The warrior slashes down only to have the nimble imp duck under his blade. The creature's tail twitches, the stinger dripping a fluid that hisses and burns the floor as it falls. 

Twice more the imp rushes at him, tearing its claws over the rapidly interposed shield. Both opponents fall back and pause, unaware of the greater battle between Wizard and Demon culminating around them. 

Cedd feels less pain than pull as his chain mail shreds under the claws of the second imp. Even as he begins to spin and face the second monster, the first jumps toward him.
