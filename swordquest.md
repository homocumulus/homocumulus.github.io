An angry stench with the taste of old hell filled its nostrils. A moment of space-less than an instant and longer than eternityâ€”found it reflected in a thousand worlds, only ten of which knew its name. Two hundred and nine of them were painfully hostile to its very existence, and on four it simply died. Its skin flamed, searing the surrounding air, heat radiating with a strength that brought the iron-hard scales of its arms to a white glow. It groaned in numb confusion and fought to empty the terror from its brain so the mind could return. A cry of pain hissed past white gleaming fangs, agony twisting through the muscles of a body torn across time.
It lay a moment in the silence, slowly extending brass claws that shone dully in the half-light. Huge black wings of dried leather rasped against the hard stone floor as it gathered itself to rise and face the insolent challenger who called it across the void. Crouching, it glared balefully into the smoky darkness.
"Who dares call me, and why?" it snarled.
An ashen voice with the crackle of old leaves filled the space around it. "I, the Darklord and rightful master of the kingdom, summon you to aid me in my desire," came the reply.
"And what shall you pay this time, O noble one?" it leered. "You rot. I smell weakness and you risk my wrath." It rose within the waning flames, majestic wings spread wide. "My service grows expensive, lord, and you waste my time.
"I do not buy you. I own you, Demon." The voice held an ancient menace. "Come. Tell me I do not."
A scream sliced through the ancient chamber. "The stone? You? You have stolen the stone of my soul!"
"And it shall be destroyed if you do not obey."
"Return it to me!" it hissed.
"Pledge your fealty, vain, or you will never crawl back to this plane again."
The large wings folded in bitter resignation. "You have my service, master. What would you have me do?"
"Revive the Temple of Dragons. Build a force and conquer Terverni. I want that land to die!"
"Idiot," he whispered to himself. "I smell weakness."
He pushed against the hard stone of the floor, rising to face this challenge that called him across the void anchoring all dimensions.
Within his heart pounded that which passed for blood in his veins, bathed in the madness of terror, and the resolution of revenge.
