my name is willow and im addicted to twitter. this is like, not ok and i intend to remedy the situation soon. i don't really want to get on another social media site like it; the negative feedback loop, the constant game you are losing against the algorithm, the literal addiction: i need it all to stop! if you're reading this and thinking, "oh no i like her posts", bear with me and sub to this rss feed using a browser extension  [https://homocumulus.github.io/feed.xml](https://homocumulus.github.io/feed.xml) cause this github page will stick around in some form or another.

after a december that was possibly one of the greatest of my life - thanks to my current relationship - this has been one of the most depressing januarys i can remember. i'm sure that's not surprising at all. it's a shitty time to be a woman let alone a trans one. i think it feels worse than 2016 cause it's no longer an anomaly, this is just the country we live in now. with that in mind i MUST find a coping mechanism that is more effective than doom scrolling cause i'm not gonna make it at this rate! i've been working on my world building a lot lately (escapism at its finest) and i swear i'm going to "publish" my first ttrpg content this spring or die trying. maybe making a valentine's card will get the creative juices flowing.

i love everyone who reads this and please be kind to yourself this next month ðŸ’—
