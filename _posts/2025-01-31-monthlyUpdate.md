my name is willow and im addicted to twitter. this is like, not ok and i intend to remedy the situation soon.

after a december that was possibly one of the greatest of my life - thanks to my current relationship - this has been one of the most depressing januarys i can remember. i'm sure that's not surprising at all. it's a shitty time to be a woman let alone a trans one. i think it feels worse than 2016 cause it's no longer an anomaly, this is just the country we live in now.

with that in mind i MUST find a coping mechanism that is more effective than doom scrolling cause i'm not gonna make it at this rate! i've been working on my world building a lot lately (escapism at its finest) and i swear i'm going to "publish" my first ttrpg content this spring or die trying.

in case this gets auto posted before i write more, i love everyone who reads this and please be kind to yourself this next month ðŸ’—
