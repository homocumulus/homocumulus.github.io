Hi! OK so it's been a month since the last blog post but that's ok! Finding motivation is funny, maybe it's more like inspiration? Well, I touched grass.

Sadly we didn't go on a proper hike, but I did manage to drag the mutt <3 to the dog park and we ended up getting a 5k walk in. The weather is finally starting to warm up and the sun and the clouds have been divine the past few days! Someone remind me to dump the latest batch of pics onto flickr...anyway, Linus kept up a brisk pace cause he was hoping for a pup-cup at the end of it all (he didn't get one as our local spot is no longer doing walkups) but he got some pb treats and now he's nice and tired so I get some peace and quiet!

I decided to use that extra time to make some muffins, pumpkin spice from a box- I'm certainly not a baker, but even we can't mess *that* up. They turned out great, and I somehow managed not to fuck them up removing them from the tray.
