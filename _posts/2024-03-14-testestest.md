hi, willow here, basically i hate twitter and "notification" addicted social media

i've never thought of myself as a writer. i still don't, but it seems like the only medium that is easy enough for me to access that i might actually use it. that makes me feel like i'm going to be making Content but this place is for content: funny little thoughts and disjointed paragraphs. so here we are. here i am. a funny little github page.

there might be clouds idk i need to figure that out

leave a comment or a reaction to give me endorphins
