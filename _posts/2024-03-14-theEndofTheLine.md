tldr i hate twitter and i want an online place to put things

hi, willow here

i've never thought of myself as a writer.  i still don't, but it seems like the only medium that is easy enough for me to access that i might actually use it.  that makes me feel like i'm going to be making Content but this place is for content: funny little thoughts and disjointed paragraphs.  so here we are.  here i am.  a funny little github page.

there might be clouds idk i need to figure that out

ðŸ’— ttly
