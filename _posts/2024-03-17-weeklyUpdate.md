it turns out it is really weird to write more than 140 characters after having used twitter as my only form of socialization for years. it's like i even think in tweetable chunks of information. what that means is i'm going to have to plan out these posts, write some things down throughout the day. which is the antithesis of my approach to social media: totally unplanned and unpredictable. the funny thing is, when i start to think like that i start to have all these ideas for Content, like blog posts about tabletop rpgs, or video games, or movies, or my adventure hacking my dslr, or other things of that nature. 

you might notice "weekly update" in the tags and that's cause I want to make a post every weekend to kind of keep track of my life. this might change, or become something else, or move somewhere else, but that's where my head is at right now soooo

###Weekly Update

sadly no hike today - linus is beside himself - so no pics to post from that. i'm not totally decided on how many images i want to post on the blog, but with the clouds on flickr they are easy to link to at least. 

##oh! happy st patrick's day!
